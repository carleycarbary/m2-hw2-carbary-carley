<h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
<p>My main hobbies are: 
-Exercising, I love to vary my workouts, so since I teach cycling 2 times a week, I like to balance that out by doing HIIT workouts 2 times a week also.
-Watching movies and tv
-Line dancing, which I consider to be both a workout and a fun socializing time. 
- I like cooking and eating. I try to be open to new foods and restaurants. 
-I like to paint if I have time.</p>
